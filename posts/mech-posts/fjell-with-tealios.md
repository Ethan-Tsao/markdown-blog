# From Mekanisk

> Fjell is known in the community for its sound properties, design language, and compatibility. In addition, with more color and kit options available than ever before, you get the complete package from Mekanisk.com. At almost 2000g, this keyboard offers a heavy, great-feeling 60% keyboard experience to place on your desk.

# Overview

The Mekanisk Fjell is certainly a high end luxury board by any standard although not at the super high end of mech prices. It's a 60% tray mount board made of aluminum with a gorgeous brass backplate. Unfortunately, I missed out on their signature ultramarine but the silver is still looks fantastic. It's a simple board that delivers on everything it promises.

# Sound

As you can hear in the video, it's actually quite high pitched. I have Tealios V2 switches lubed with a 1:1 mixture of Krytox 205G0 and Krytox 105. Tealios are sort of middle of the pack in terms of pitch for switches. Normally, I really like lower pitched sounds so I love switches like Gateron Ink Black or even NovelKeys' Dry Blacks. But the particular combination on this board creates a pretty unique sound that I've slowly fallen in love with over time. I got the pom plate to go with it which is generally a little lower pitched than aluminum but a little higher pitched than something like FR4. But the solid aluminum build certainly reflects all of that sound back out.

It would 100% be my daily driver if it were a 65% (as a software engineer, gotta have them arrow keys). Mekanisk, if by some miracle you read this, PLEASE make a 65% Tind. We joke about end game all the time in the community but honestly, a 65% Tind with Gateron Ink Blacks and FR4 plate? Chef's kiss.

Originally, I had some cheap HyperX pudding caps on this board, but I damn near threw up at the sound that produced. Not to mention the blasphemy of having such an unaesthetic keycap set on this beauty. Nothing against HyperX though. I have the keycaps for a reason. Just not for this reason. Instead I got MT3 Susuwatari from Drop and threw those on. At least the gray kinda matches the silver case? And it sounds much better. My SA Mizu set finally came in so that's finally on it and the build was finally fully complete.

# Price

Now let's talk about money. Here's my build:

- Fjell keyboard case: $297
- POM mounting plate: $17.50
- Mekanisk dampening foam: $12
- WT60-D PCB: $60
- Mekanisk ultramarine stablizers: $19
- Tealios V2 (70): $59.50
- Drop MT3 Susuwatari: $120
- \+ Tax & Shipping
  = $670.09 :/

Yeah...this build was pricey for sure. I didn't even include the price for the lube or the switch films. It's a yikes for sure but the whole build delivers. It really does.

# Conclusion

As one of my first high-end builds, given the performance and price, and given a Tind 65% doesn't happen, this will likely be my last. Haha okay let's be real I'm in deep with nothing but a shovel. But this board is everything I wished for. The way it sounds in the video doesn't do justice to the experience of actually typing on this. Even as a tray mount on a massive aluminum board, it's not even stiff. It's just a pleasant experience all around. If you see the price tag and are even questioning it, don't get it. This isn't your sign for a make or break decision. If you have the money and it happens to be available, absolutely 100% pick this board up. You won't regret it.
